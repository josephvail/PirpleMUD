Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"

Examples:

  &gt; tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
  No-one by that name here.

  &gt; ^rasmusse^rasmussen
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

  &gt; ^you^you doing^
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'
