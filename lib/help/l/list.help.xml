Usage: list [item type]

If you'd like to see what items a shop has for sale, take a look at the
list.  The list contains all of the items currently for sale and in
what quantity.  The price for each item is also listed.  If you are
interested in a particular type of item, you can specify which items to
list.
 
Examples:
 
  &gt; list             (list all items for sale)
  &gt; list sword       (list all swords for sale)
