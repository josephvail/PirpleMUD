	<entry>QUIT

When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'.
Note that quitting this way may cause any items you might be carrying to
simply be left on the ground (Dependant upon how the game is currently
configured).  If you wish to have your equipment stored, you may have to
find an inn and pay rent.
