	<entry>QUEST

Usage: quest

This simple toggle command merely informs the Powers that Be that you
wish to participate in the currently running Quest.  If an immortal
is running a Quest and needs to know who wishes to participate, he/she
will ask players to turn on their Quest flags using this QUEST command
if they are interested in the Quest.  It also allows you to listen in on
the quest channel and receive information specific to the quest.
