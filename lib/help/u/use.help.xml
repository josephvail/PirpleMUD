	<entry>USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Usage: use &lt;staff&gt;
       use &lt;wand&gt; &lt;Target&gt;

Using a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself.  Therefore staffs are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use!  (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.
