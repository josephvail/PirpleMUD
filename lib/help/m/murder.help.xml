Usage: murder &lt;victim&gt;

Kill command to hit another player.  To avoid accidental flagging (i.e.
trying to type "kiss Nia" but accidentally typing "kill Nia").

Note that it is illegal to kill other players.  If you try you will get
a KILLER flag.  If you are flagged as a killer, you are unable to do
damage and other players will be allowed to use the MURDER command to
kill you without being flagged themselves.
