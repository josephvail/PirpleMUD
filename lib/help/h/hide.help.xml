	<entry>HIDE

Thieves Only.

When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room.  If hidden
you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell.  Even if sensed your
identity will remain hidden.  Hide is broken by pressing return, regardless
of whether you typed a command or not.

Example:

  &gt; hide
  Ok.
  &gt;  (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)

  &gt;  (You pressed enter and no longer hide)
