Usage: dc &lt;descriptor number&gt;

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket.  If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.
