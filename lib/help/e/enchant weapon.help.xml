This spell will enchant non-magical (non-modifying) weapons only.
By non-modifying weapons we refer to weapons that might alter any
ability such as for example damage.  The only way to know if a weapon
is suitable for enchantment is to fully identify it.

The enchantment will modify the weapon as:

    Level    Hit Roll    Damage

     0..17     +1         +1
    18..19     +2         +1
    20..20+    +2         +2
