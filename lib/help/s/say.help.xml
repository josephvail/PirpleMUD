	<entry>SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT YELL HOLLER '

Usage: say | shout | holler &lt;string&gt;
       tell | whisper | ask &lt;player&gt; &lt;string&gt;

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

Examples:

  &gt; say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  &gt; tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

  &gt; ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.  Holler
broadcasts to everyone in the game but costs 20 movement points.  You must
be level 2 before you can use shout and yell.
