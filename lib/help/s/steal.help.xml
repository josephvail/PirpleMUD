Thief Only.

Usage: steal &lt;item&gt; &lt;victim&gt;

Use steal to steal gold or items from people.  The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is now illegal to steal from other
players.  Doing so will get you a flag for your trouble.

Examples:

  &gt; steal gold drunk
  &gt; steal sword mercenary
    (If it's wielded, only possible if he is sleeping)
