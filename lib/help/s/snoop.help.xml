	<entry>SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command; 
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop &lt;your name&gt; or just snoop to stop snooping.
