Clerics have an ancient belief in not carrying sharp weapons.  Hence, they can
only wield bludgeoning weapons.  This class gives you the wisdom of peace,
blessing and healing, though it is possible to learn more violent spells.

You can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See 'help spells' for a list of spells available.
