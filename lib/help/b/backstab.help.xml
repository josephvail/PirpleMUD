Thief only.

Backstab is a way to sneak up on a person and attempt to place your dagger
in his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage.  A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level:

    Levels  Multiplier
    ------  ----------
     1-7        2
     8-13       3
    14-20       4
    21-30       5

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild.  You can always backstab sleeping
people.
