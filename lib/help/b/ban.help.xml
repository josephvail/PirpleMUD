Usage: ban [&lt;all | new | select&gt; &lt;site&gt;]
       unban &lt;site&gt;

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  &gt; ban all whitehouse.gov
  &gt; unban ai.mit.edu
