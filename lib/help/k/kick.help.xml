Fighters only.

Usage: kick &lt;victim&gt;

The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned.  The higher
level you reach the harder you kick.  There is one small catch -- whenever
you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for three 
rounds of 'Violence' -- so be sure that you do not need to flee!
