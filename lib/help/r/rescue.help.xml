	<entry>RESCUE

Fighters Only.

Usage: rescue &lt;victim&gt;

This command is useful if you want to try and make an attacker hit you
instead of your poor friend who is being pummeled.  You can only 'turn'
one monster for each rescue attempt.  This is very useful when playing
in groups, of course.

Example:

  &gt; rescue Yankee
