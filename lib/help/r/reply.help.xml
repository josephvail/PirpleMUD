	<entry>REPLY

Usage: reply &lt;message&gt;

This command will send a reply to the last person to send you a message
using TELL.  It works just as if you had typed 'tell &lt;player&gt; &lt;message&gt;'
but makes it a bit easier.  It can also be very useful in case someone
invisible sends you a message.

Example:

Ras tells you, 'Hi!'
&gt; reply hey
You tell Ras, 'hey'
&gt;
Someone tells you, 'I am your secret admirer.'
&gt; reply Who are you?
You tell someone, 'Who are you?'
