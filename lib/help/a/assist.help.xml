Usage: ASSIST &lt;person in need&gt;

If Quifael is being beaten senseless by a warg and you feel brave enough
to help him, type ASSIST QUIFAEL to hit the warg.  Note that the warg will
keep hitting Quifael; assist only makes you start to fight whomever the
person you're assisting is fighting.
