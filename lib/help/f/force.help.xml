Usage: force &lt;victim | all&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

Example:

  &gt; force fido drop meat
  &gt; force all save
  &gt; force room look fido

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.
