Usage: flee

If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little uncomfortable
(maybe you are dying), just type 'flee', and presto!  You are out of harms way
- that is, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit doesn't simply
bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, who wants to live forever?
