	<entry>FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze &lt;victim&gt;
       thaw &lt;victim&gt;

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.
