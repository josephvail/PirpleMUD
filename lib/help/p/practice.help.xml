Usage: practice [skill or spell name]

Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills.  You can only do
so in your guild, where your guildmaster can help you train.  Type
"practice &lt;skill&gt;" to improve your abilities while in your guild.  You can
only practice a certain amount for each level you gain.  Unused practice
sessions will accumulate for use in future levels.

If you type practice anywhere other than in your guild, you will get a list
of all of the spells and skills you know and your level of proficiency at
each.
