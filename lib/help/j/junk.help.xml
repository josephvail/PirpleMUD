Usage: junk &lt;object&gt;
       junk &lt;number&gt; coins

Use JUNK instead of DROP if you want to keep the world a little cleaner.  If
you JUNK something, it will disappear and you'll get a few coins or experience
points, just as if you had dropped it in the dump.

Examples:

  &gt; junk cup
  &gt; junk all.bronze
  &gt; junk 500 coins

See also: DONATE, DROP
