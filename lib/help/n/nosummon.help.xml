Usage: nosummon

Due to problems we've had with players killing other players by summoning
them to Bad Places, all characters now have SUMMON PROTECTION turned on by
default.  This prevents people from summoning you and gives you a warning
message if someone tries.  If you want to let someone summon you (i.e. if
someone wants to summon you for a legitimate reason), type NOSUMMON to turn
off summon protection.  You can then type NOSUMMON again to turn protection
back on.
