	<entry>WARRIOR FIGHTER

Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.  This makes
them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills of violence and
fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.  However, they lack the
ability to use magic of any sort.

You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

Skills available to warriors:

kick, rescue, track, bash
