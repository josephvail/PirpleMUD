Usage: wear &lt;item&gt; [location]

If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.

Also, to wear everything in your inventory (or at least try to, as wearing 
things like loaves of bread is not a good way to win friends and influence
people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

Examples:

  &gt; wear boots
  &gt; wear all.bronze
  &gt; wear all
  &gt; wear ring finger
