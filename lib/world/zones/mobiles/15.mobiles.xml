		<long_description>You resist the urge to avert your eyes from the sight of the one true God.
</long_description>
		<description>The sight is for each man a different, a mirror into the true nature of
each person's body and soul.  At first a proud, bitter old man, but just
as easily a gentle extended hand, a smile, and gardens... gardens.

that too fades, and you see nothing.
