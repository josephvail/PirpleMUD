		<description>You are standing in the workshop of Froboz the Great, the most powerful and
famous mage that Rome has ever known.  Workbenches line the walls and are
covered with various test tubes, beakers, petri dishes and crucibles and
there is an odor in here that can best be described as a combination of old
sweat socks and burning tires.  The only exit is back through the door
through which you came.  In the middle of the room, you see a pile of ashes
that looks like it once was a body and Froboz is is busy making adjustments
on a new type of magic wand... possibly the one responsible for the explosion
a few minutes ago.  He removes a jeweler's loupe from his eye as he turns
around.  'How in the name of Merlin did you get in here??!!' he asks.  'Oh,
nevermind!  Since you are here, you can serve as witnesses to the final test
of the new mages' spell:  "ectowatt".'  With this he makes a magical gesture
and a paladin appears.  Crossing his fingers, Froboz waves the wand his
direction and what happens next is incredible!  The Paladin is enveloped in
what appears to be a small, well contained, thermonuclear explosion.  When
the smoke clears you can see that the paladin and all of equipment has been
reduced to a large pile of flaming cinders.  Froboz throws his head back and
cackles with insane glee.  'Now, my young friends, what can I do for you?',
he asks.
