angle turn.  The passage leads north and east from here.  The
way to the north seems to be a longer tunnel which continues

is a fresh change from what would normally be found this far
underground in that the tunnel seems to open  up into a fairly
large and well lit cave.

		<description>   You find yourself in a small passage ending.  It is quite dark in here.
As you look about the damp walls, you notice that the passageway almost
appears to curve upwards towards the ceiling.  Looking up, you notice that
there is a small hole, just large enough to pass through.  Looking closely
at the curved part of the wall, it appears that someone (or something) has
carved small handholds into the wall to ease passage upwards.  The tunnel
itself leads off to the east.

		<description>   You find yourself in quite an ordinary passageway which leads north
and south.  It looks to be wide enough for two people to walk side by
side with plenty of room.  The passage appears to be almost rectangular
in form.  Far off to the south you can see the pinpoint of a light.

to have been heavily visited at any time.  It leads northwards towards
a lit room and south towards what appears to be a chamber.

about twenty torches spread about the room set in sconces which hang
several feet above your head.  The dancing shadows created by the
flickering flames catch your eyes for a few minutes and threaten to
hold you entranced.
   Looking about the cave, it appears to continue to the west and
south.  In the north wall a strange vertical crack looks as if it may
lead somewhere.

		<description>   You stand in a fairly normal passage, slightly wider than is
necessary for one person, but not quite wide enough for two.  The
ceiling dips here rather surprisingly, or wait, is that because the
floor climbs upwards toward it?  The tunnel seems to narrow slightly
more as you look to the south, and widens up somewhat as you look
northward.  The light to the south continues to flicker.

about ten or twelve feet up.  The passageway funnels down towards 
the west where it leads to a doorway that looks to be about five feet
across.  The east end of the tunnel comes to a sudden end at a very
smooth rock wall.

could exist.  This small, almost perfectly round cave does not
appear to be a natural formation at all, since the walls are far
too smooth and the doorways to the north and east are both almost
exactly five feet wide and eleven feet tall.

to move carefully in order to not catch anything on the jutting rocks of
the ceiling and walls.  The diameter of the crawlway is about two feet,

worms or similar creatures down this way since it might be difficult to
defend yourself in here.
