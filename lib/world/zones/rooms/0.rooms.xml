		<description>   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

		<description>   The walls are completely bare... nothing at all in the room.
How... utterly bizarre and completely weird.  There is a strange
portal just above you, and it almost looks as if there is some
sort of room above you.
