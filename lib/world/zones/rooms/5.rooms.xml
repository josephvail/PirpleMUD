				<description>Faces of various known Killers and Thieves can barely be seen behind the
crates on the west wall.  Some of them look quite familar, sorta like that
guy who you saw in the Reception a minute ago... but then again, they are
rather hard to see past the crates.

are a couple of small wooden benches here where people occasionally sit
while they wait for items to appear.  The temple is to the west.

		<description>   You are walking on a wide dirt path through the lush, green, fresh
Midgaard countryside.  You can see to the horizon to the north, east,
and west; the busy city of Midgaard lies to the south.  All around you
is healthy green grass and an occasional large oak tree.  The sun feels
wonderful on your face and a pleasant wind blows through your hair.  Birds
chirp quietly to themselves and you can smell the faint scent of flowers
and freshly cut grass.  You feel like you could lie down in the grass and
stay here forever, surrounded by powerful beauty in all directions.
   The way north appears to be blocked by a large plot device and you cannot
see any way around it.
