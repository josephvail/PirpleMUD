		<description>   Before you, the grove of shadows lies.  Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows.  A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area.  You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
   A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the plains.

a huge black oven against one wall, it must be at least 12 feet high.
