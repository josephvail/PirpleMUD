		<description>   As the river exits the city of Midgaard it picks up speed and whisks
you along high banks flanked by the trees of Haon-Dor.  As the city
fades in the east, you approach a gloomy forest to the west.

		<description>   The river is deep, and runs swiftly in an east-west direction.  To the
north the river eddies and enters a backwash where a small bank extends
down from a dark, thick stand of trees.  It doesn't look particulary
inviting however.

		<description>   The river twists and turns and nearly tosses you out of your boat.
The water is dark, cold, almost reptilian in sheen.  It seems almost
alive.  The river runs east and south.

		<description>   The dark forest of Haon-Dor recedes behind you to the northeast.
The river continues in a westerly direction toward the river delta,
where you can just make out a large island.

		<description>   You are at the edge of the river delta, where the river empties
out on its way to the sea.  The water here is Black.  Deep.  Dark.
Deadly.  The tidal waves sweep you around and around up and down.

large, jagged rocks on the eastern shore of an unusual looking island.
There is no way you could possibly land there without getting killed.

		<description>   You are making your way along a channel in the river delta between
the island to the west and the shore to the south and east.  To the
south an aging broken down looking pier juts out from land and toward
the west the channel works it way close to the island as it moves around
its southern tip.

		<description>   The going is rough here.  The tide struggles with the normal flow
of the river and here near the edge of the sea there is a large
amount of growth.  To the west the channel passes the southern tip of
the island and heads for open waters.

		<description>   The delta meets the sea here.  To the west you see nothing but
ocean on the horizon.  Sea birds squawk noisily at your approach
and take flight from a nearby beach head on the island.  It looks
as though this could be the last stop for those heading out to sea.
