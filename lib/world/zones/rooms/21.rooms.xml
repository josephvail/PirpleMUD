		<description>   You have solved the maze.  You can tell by the last few moves
that there is no way that a dumb worker could have figured that
out.  It seems pretty desolate here.  To the south is a bleak
room.  To the north, you see the maze.  There is a sign above
the south exit:

THOSE WHO ENTER, PLAN ON A TIMELY DEATH.
(ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LOYAL TO THE QUEEN)

		<description>   You have entered the Mazekeeper's room.  There are pictures of
the Queen with darts thrown at it.  Spraypainted on the wall are
things like 'the queen shall suffer' and 'Catholics Rule'.
