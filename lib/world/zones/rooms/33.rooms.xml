		<description>   This trail slopes up and away from the main road to 
the west.  At points the trail seems to fade into 
obscurity against the grey stone and near-grey mountain 
grass prevalent here.  The trail leads generally eastward 
and up higher into the rocky ground.  There is a sign 
here, seemingly out-of-place in this rough country.

down to a valley where there seems to be a small village!  
What a village is doing this far from civilization, and how
they survive you've no idea.  From the smoke wafting from 
some of the chimneys, it looks like this place is still 
inhabited as well.
   Now if you can only get down this slope without breaking
