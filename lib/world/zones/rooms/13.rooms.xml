		<description>   What a shame that this mass destruction also touched this once
beautiful place.  The temple's garden path has nothing on this garden.
Flowers and trees have been smashed into the ground and lawn benches
thrown through walls.  A large marble fountain in the center of the
courtyard still stands, though, defying any attempts to destroy its
beauty.  Above stands the remnants of one of the watchtowers.  Archways 
north and west lead back into the city hall.

one time this could have been an inn of some sort, but now it is just
a mess.  The back wall as been completely knocked down revealing an 
entrance into another building through yet another collapsed wall.
Between the two buildings are a few blast craters and boulders.  An old
set of wooden steps leads up to a creaking second floor.

with the back wall missing, it could hold many more.  Looking around you
find broken shelves and workbenches with various vials and pouches spilling
contents all across the floor.  This was possibly the magic shop of the
city.  The doorway to the east is blocked, making the only exit back west.

a city here seem much more reasonable).  Closer inspection of the water
yields a dead body floating around in it, skin melted away from months
of floating in there.  The west wall has collapsed revealing another
collapsed house.

Unfortunately, it succumbed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desecrated.  Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
you.  A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tongue.  
     Wind gusts through the four archways and howls and screams can be
heard from all parts of the city.
