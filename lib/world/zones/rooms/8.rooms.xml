		<description>   You are standing on the plains.  This is a vast desolate place where
the wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you bars its way.  However
you are not the first to wander here.  Before you somebody has left a small
path.  The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead
to anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind
to enter the hills far away north.  A narrow trail scars its way off to the
east as it leads up towards a hillside.

from seeing far in any direction save east, where a broad lane continues off
into the distance; and west, where the same lane continues towards what looks
like a fairly large city.  The muted sounds of city commotion reach your ears
from a distance; stray dogs barking, children crying, and street salesmen
shouting.
   A steep path leads down from here to the northeast towards the Dwarven
Village, and a small trail leads through the trees towards the hills to the
north.

the keeper and his help throw a good deal of garbage here.  A couple of
piles of rubbish are to the west, but you will smell the worse for
meddling there.  As a clean alternative, you can go north or east around
the Inn.

		<description>   You are in the common room of the Woodsman Inn.  A thin haze of smoke
sits in the air here.  The Inn is often empty, as the forest has become
overrun by goblins as of late, and it is no longer safe in these parts.
The bar is just north of here.  If you'd rather have your own table, one
is empty to the south.
